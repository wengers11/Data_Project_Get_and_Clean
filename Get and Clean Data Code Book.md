Variables
=================

Activity_Name: The name of 1 of the 6 activities that the subjects went subject to.
(WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING)

Subject_ID: A number 1 through 30 corresponding to each of the 30 subjects.

Activity_ID: An ID number corresponding to the Activity Names above. Mapping as follows,
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Various Feature's average by a unique subject/activity combination: 
See below for more details on features included.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ,
tGravityAcc-XYZ,
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ,
tBodyGyro-XYZ,
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ,
tBodyAccMag,
tGravityAccMag,

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value,
std(): Standard deviation
